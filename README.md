## 🧐 Why This Project?
JavaScript is famous for its quirks (e.g., `[] == ![]` being `true`). While these look like memes, they are rooted in the ECMAScript specification. This project aims to:
- Document "WTF" moments in JS.
- Explain the underlying logic behind these edge cases.
- Help developers avoid common pitfalls in production.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Interactive Spoiler:** Guess the output before revealing the answer.
- **Multilingual Support:** All cases are documented in both English and Korean.
- **Data-Driven:** Easily extensible via `cases.json`.

## 🛠 How to Contribute
We love new "king-bad" (annoying) JS snippets! If you know a weird behavior:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Add your case to `cases.json`.
3. Open a Pull Request.

Please check [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.
